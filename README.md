# socialnetwork_skeleton

This project is a template for my ongoing freelancing project on Blockchain. 

socialnetwork_skeleton for now consists of 3 main functions of Create Post, Tip Post(In ETH) and List Post with highest tipped on top.

The Project will further give a shape of a crowd-sourcing web app in which people can post their projects/business ideas for funding. The investors who fund the project will receive a special ERC20 Token which will be specific to the token. The Lockin period will be decided in the contract itself which cannot be changed as it is on the blockchain.

The speciality of building this project idea on a blockchain is that once any project/ business idea is written it cannot be altered which creates trust among Investors. It will have a feature just like ICO. 

This code can be deployed on Ethereum, Binance & Polygon blockchain network.

Framework used : Truffle
Demo deployment : Ganache
Languages and Libraries : Web3.js, Solidity, React, Bootstrap.
